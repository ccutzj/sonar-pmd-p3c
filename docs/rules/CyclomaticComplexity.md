<p>
  Complexity is determined by the number of decision points in a method plus one for the method entry. The decision
  points are 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case labels'. Generally, 1-4 is low complexity, 5-7 indicates moderate
  complexity, 8-10 is high complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity.
