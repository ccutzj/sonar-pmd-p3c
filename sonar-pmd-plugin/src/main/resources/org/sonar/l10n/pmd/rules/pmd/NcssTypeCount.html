<!-- (c) 2020 PMD -->
This rule uses the NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines of code for a given type. NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm, lines of code that are split are counted as one.
<h2>Example:</h2>
<pre>
public class Foo extends Bar {
    public Foo() {
        //this class only has 6 NCSS lines
        super();





        super.foo();
    }
}
</pre>

  This rule is deprecated, use {rule:java:S104} instead.
