If an abstract class does not provide any method, it may be acting as a simple data container that is not meant to be instantiated. In this case, it is probably better to use a private or protected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract.
<h2>Example:</h2>
<pre>
public class abstract Example {
  String field;
  int otherField;
}
</pre>
